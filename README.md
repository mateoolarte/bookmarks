# Learning knowledge base

This repository contains a lot of links to different articles, talks, books, courses etc. Related to web development and in general things about tech industry.

## Motivation

When you are searching to learn a new technology you feel overwhelmed about all of the content that is out there so the idea behind this is to create a practical guide and curated content about what resources I used to learn a certain topic. Many of these links work not matter what time you are looking so I try to give you the most complete information related to the technology and how can you continue learning more. Also this keep me on track about what things I'm learning

## How this works

To keep track of the things that I learned I will create a branch for every month and put in the README.md` the resources that I look through

**_Updated 26 Nov 2020:_** _I will make an update about how this repository will work so I will not keep track of every month with branches and replace them with the Lastest thing that I learned and register by commits in which date I start doing that_

**_Updated 11 Dec 2020:_** _I will go back to month branches so I can see in a more organized way what kind of things I learned through the month_
