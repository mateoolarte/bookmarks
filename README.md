# Learning roadmap

This repository contains a lot of links to different articles, talks, books, courses etc. Related to web development

## Motivation

When you are searching to learn a new technology you feel overwhelmed about all of the content that is out there so the idea behind this is to create a practical guide and curated content about what resources I used to learn a certain topic. Many of these links work not matter what time you are looking so I try to give you the most complete information related to the technology and how can you continue learning more. Also this keep me on track about what things I'm learning

## How this works

To keep track of the things that I learned I will create a branch for every month and put in the `README.md` the resources that I look through
